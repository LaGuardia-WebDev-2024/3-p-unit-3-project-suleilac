      <strong>Step 1:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients:
      flour, baking powder, and salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a second bowl (or bowl of your stand mixer),
      beat together softened butter and sugar on medium-high speed 5 minutes
      until thick and fluffy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat in eggs 1 at a time, mixing to incorporate
      with each egg then blend in vanilla and scrape down the bowl.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Reduce mixer to medium speed and add the flour in
      thirds, alternating with adding the 1/2 cup buttermilk and beating well
      between additions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Pour batter into 12 lined muffin tins, filling
      2/3 full. Bake in the center of the oven at 350ËšF for 20-23 minutes, or
      until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool 5
      minutes in the pan then remove cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour,
      sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry
      ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean sized bits
      of butter.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>
      Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the
      bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water
      over the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>
      Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until
      thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>
      Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve, and core the apples.
      Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the
      sugar and toss to combine evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>
      In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples,
      and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to
      simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until
      the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>
      Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice.
      Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to
      the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly
      caramelized, about 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>
      In a medium bowl, toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices. Set
      aside to cool completely.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong>
      Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half of
      dough into a disc about 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between
      pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at
      least 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong>
      Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375
      degrees F.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 10:</strong>
      Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and
      trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Put the
      apple filling in the pan and mound it slightly in the center. Brush the
      top edges of the dough with the egg. Place the second disc of dough over
      the top. Fold the top layer of dough under the edge of the bottom layer
      and press the edges together to form a seal. Flute the edge as desired.
      Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar.
      Pierce the top of the dough in several places to allow steam to escape
      while baking. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 11:</strong>
      Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the crust is golden, about 50
      minutes. Cool on a rack before serving.
